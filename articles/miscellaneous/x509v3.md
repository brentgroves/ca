Authority Info Access.
The authority information access extension gives details about how to access certain information relating to the CA. Its syntax is accessOID;location where location has the same syntax as subject alternative name (except that email:copy is not supported). accessOID can be any valid OID but only certain values are meaningful, for example OCSP and caIssuers.

Example:

 authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:http://ocsp.my.host/
 authorityInfoAccess = caIssuers;URI:http://my.ca/ca.html
